ECE354 RTX Group 031

This version contains the fix made during the lab demo to add PID checking to 
message sending.

Documentation:

Part 2B documentation is located in docs/p2b.pdf.

Files:

  main.c - main rtx entry point
  rtx.c and rtx.h - system calls
  README - this file
  core/ - all core kernel logic 
  docs/ - documenattion
  lib/ - debug and string libraries
  loader/ - supplied rtx loader
  tests/ - sets of test case programs

Building:

The Makefile generates a combined loader + rtx image located in main.s19.

For every c file in tests/, a s19 is generated and merged with main.s19, into a
file name full_testname.s19.

Building for demos:

`make demo` generates s19 files from each s19 file inside demo/. Each file is
merged in turn with rtx.s19, and a demo_filename.s19 file is generated.
