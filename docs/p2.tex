\subsection*{Null Process}
The null process was implemented as defined by the project specifications. It
has a priority of 4 and a process ID of 0. The process method is defined in
\texttt{system\_process.c} as an infinite loop that constantly calls
\texttt{release\_processor()}. It is added to the process table through a call to
\texttt{init\_null\_process()} found in init.c. This call should always be the first
call made to add processes to the process tables as it assumes that it is at
the 0th index of the process table array. This will be fine as the
initialization of this process is handled by the main function of the RTX.
