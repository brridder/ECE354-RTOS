This document is concerned with the high level implementation of the 
specified primitives. As such, most of the low level back end is omitted for
simplicity. Any kernel structures required to understand the primitive are
described when the primitive is discussed.

\subsection*{RTX Initialization of Memory Management} 
The final phase of the RTX initialization is the memory management phase.
Memory blocks are allocated beginning at the start of free memory. The function
call \texttt{init\_memory(void* memory\_start)}, as seen in
Listing~\ref{meminit}. A free list is used to implement linking and management
of the memory blocks. A free list is a singly linked list that stores the
address of the next free memory in the first four bytes of the current memory
block. The only pointer required is to the head of this list. Push and pop
operations can be done in $O(1)$ time. Over-allocation and double deallocation
prevention is handled by a bit field containing a bit for each memory block.
When the memory is allocation the associated bit is set to 1 and for when it is
released it is set back to 0.

\lstset{caption={Pseudo code for RTX initialization of memory
        management},label=meminit}
\begin{lstlisting}
void init_memory(void* memory_start){
    
    head of memory = start of free memory + (number of memory blocks - 1)*(size of memory block)
    
    for each block in free list:
        store address of next free memory block in current block

    initialize the memory allocation bit field to 0
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Request and Release Memory Block}
The \texttt{request\_memory\_block()} and \texttt{release\_memory\_block()}
primitives are used by the operating system to allocate and deallocate memory
blocks for processes.

Requesting a memory block is shown in pseudo code in
Listing~\ref{requestmemory}. First a mode switch to kernel mode is made. After
the mode switch, a check is made to see if any memory blocks are available. If
there are no available memory blocks, the process is moved to a blocked state
and the processor is released. If memory is available, the memory block is
popped off of the free list. The block index is retrieved and the appropriate memory
allocation bit is set high. Finally, the memory block address is returned.

\lstset{caption={Pseudo code for requesting memory blocks}, label=requestmemory}
\begin{lstlisting}
void* request_memory_block(){
    mode switch to kernel mode

    if no available memory blocks:
        running process state = blocked on memory
        release_processor()
    else:
        pop block of memory off the free list        
        get block index
        set corresponding bit in memory allocation field to 1

    return address of block
}
\end{lstlisting}

Releasing a memory block is shown in the pseudo code in
Listing~\ref{releasememory}. First a system call is made using the address of
the memory block as a parameter.  After the mode switch is performed, a check
is made to determine the index in the allocation field of the block. This index
is used to see if this block is currently allocated. If it is not then the
system returns \texttt{RTX\_ERROR}. If the block has been allocated then the
block is pushed back on to the free list and that bit in the memory allocation
field is set back to 0. Next, a check is made to see if there are any processes
currently blocked on memory. If any are found, the first blocked process has
its state set to ready and \texttt{RTX\_SUCCESS} is returned. If there are no
processes blocked on memory then \texttt{RTX\_SUCCESS} is returned right away.

\lstset{caption={Pseudo code for releasing memory blocks}, label=releasememory}
\begin{lstlisting}
int release_memory_block(void* memory_block){
    mode switch to kernel mode

    if memory block is not allocated:
        return RTX_ERROR
    else:
        push block back on to free list
        set correct bit in memory allocation field to 0

            if there are processes blocked on memory:
                set state of first blocked process to ready

        return RTX_SUCCESS        
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Send and Receive Messages}

The primitives \texttt{send\_message(...)} and \texttt{receive\_message(...)}
are used by processes to send and receive messages between them. Each process
has its own message queue which is setup upon process initialization.
When a process sends a message it is enqueued to the message queue of the
receiving process. When a process attempts to receive a message it polls its
own message queue.

Listing~\ref{sendmsg} describes the functionality of
\texttt{send\_message(...)}.  First, a system call is made with the
process id of the receiver and a pointer to the message envelope. The
system call then switches into kernel mode. Once the mode switch is
complete the message is then pushed on the end of the recipient's
message queue. There is no size limit on the message queue so this
will never cause an error. A check is then made to see if the
recipient process is currently blocked on receiving messages. If this
is the case the state of this process is set to ready. Then
\texttt{RTX\_SUCCESS} is returned.

\lstset{caption={Pseudo code for sending messages}, label=sendmsg}
\begin{lstlisting}
int send_message(int process_id, void* message_envelope){
    mode switch to kernel mode

    push message on to end of message queue

    if receiving process is blocked on messages:
        set state of receiving process to ready

    return RTX_SUCCESS
}
\end{lstlisting}


Pseudo code for \texttt{receive\_message(...)} is shown in
Listing~\ref{receivemsg}. A system call is made to switch the system
into kernel mode. In this system call a pointer for storing the
process id of the sender is passed in as a parameter. Upon switching
to kernel mode the running process checks to see if its message queue
is empty. If the message queue is empty the process is now blocked on
messages. The processes' state is changed to reflect this and release
processor is called. If the queue is not empty the message is popped
off the queue, the process id of the sender is written to the
\texttt{sender\_id} pointer, and the message is returned.

\lstset{caption={Pseudo code for receiving messages}, label=receivemsg}
\begin{lstlisting}
void* receive_message(int* sender_id){
    mode switch to kernel mode

    if message queue for running process is empty:
        running process state = blocked on messages
        release_processor()
    else:
        pop message off queue
        *sender_id = process id of the message sender
        return message      
}
\end{lstlisting}
